# Show Google locations.json file

This browser app helps you read the contents of a Google locations JSON file for your Android phone,
once you have downloaded it from https://www.google.com/settings/takeout.

The app is plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I wrote it mainly for playing with the JavaScript FileReader object,

Tested with Google Chrome 44 only.
