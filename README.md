# Show Google locations.json file

This browser app helps you read the contents of a Google locations JSON file for your Android phone,
once you have downloaded it from https://www.google.com/settings/takeout.

The app is plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  I wrote it mainly for playing with the JavaScript FileReader object.

Tests:
- OK with Google Chrome 44 and Firefox 40 (MS Windows 8.1 and 10).
- MS Edge currently does not (yet) support Drag+Drop as implemented: must Click to read a file.
